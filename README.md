# dash_cm_plot

This repository presents the first version of an interactive plot tool for batteries analysis made in Dash by the Plotly application. Developed jointly with Caio Ferreira Bernardo and Alana Aragon Zulke, this is a public version of the project made so far. Any feedbacks and collaborations are welcome as well.

Obrigado, Matheus Alves.
